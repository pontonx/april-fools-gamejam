## **Description**

Welcome to Office Fools, the only workplace where productivity is low, but prank levels are dangerously high!
It’s just another day at the office—until you find a mysterious talking watch that claims it can stop time. 
And what better way to use such power than to pull the greatest office pranks in history? Rotate a monitor, throw out someone’s mouse , infect someone's computer—the possibilities are endless!
But as you wreak havoc, something feels… off. Your co-workers seem a little too frozen. The boss isn’t reacting. And why does everyone look like they’re waiting for something?
Could it be that you’re not the only fool in this office?
Uncover the truth, escape the ultimate prank, and remember—in Office Fools, time may not be as frozen as you think.
