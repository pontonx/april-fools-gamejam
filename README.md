Welcome to **Office Fools**, the only workplace where productivity is low, but prank levels are dangerously high!  

It’s just another day at the office—until you stumble upon a **mysterious talking watch** that claims it can **stop time**.  
And what better way to use such power than to pull **the greatest office pranks in history**?  

🎭 **Turn the office into chaos!**  
✅ Rotate a monitor  
✅ Toss out a co-worker’s mouse  
✅ Infect someone's computer  
✅ Turn off someone's computer

But as you **wreak havoc**, something feels… off.

📋 The boss isn’t reacting.
